# ACE-Application
For this project, we were required to work in a group and develop a C++ application of our own choice and apply the advanced C++ programming techniques that we 
learnt throughout the course. I was the leader of my group. My group of 3 decided to design a simple card game application called ACE. This application was designed 
on the basis of a world famous game called UNO. We added our own unique touch to it. The aim of our game was to allow people of all age groups to be able to interact
with each other and socialize whilst still being safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our game ‘ACE’ will provide hours of fun and entertainment whilst facilitating 
bonds, developing fine motor skills, enhancing strategic thinking and memory, teaching the art of winning and losing gracefully as well as the importance of rule 
following. The ide used for this project was Code Blocks.
